Meeting:
- Goes in to the UI, goes out from the UI
- Line number thing

Ideas:
- exec is in the same process
- the rest of the program can get the variables in the exec when namespace is retreived
- Syntax Error handling
- Runtime Error handling
- Path handling
- Text copy and paste
- Redo and Undo
- Cross platform check
- Key Bindings
- AST check
- Scroll bar
- line highlight
- line see

    !!! do not use execution_sequence
    !!! do not run forever
    !!! do not write to file
