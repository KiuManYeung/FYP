Meeting notes:
- AST line number??
- I lost memory of the meeting





Ideas:
- AST
    - Figure how to use AST
    - Insert different kinds of statement in AST
    - Insert statement after every line in AST
    - Execute altered AST
    - Get line number
- lolviz
    - Generate graphs as examples






Data structures(CS2515):
*- Lists
*- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Queues Doubly Linked Lists
- List ADT
- Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- Binary Tree ADT
- Balanced Binary Trees
- Set ADT
- Priority Queue ADT
- Binary HEAP
- MAP ADT
- Hash Tables
Data structures(CS2516):
- Graph ADT
- Adaptable Priority Queues





Graphing tool:

graphviz:
- Output pdf, svg...
- tk for tkinter
- gkt for GKT

lolviz:
- Depends on graphviz
- Solved: Output to svg no problem
    - graph.format = 'svg'
- Solved: For the same execution only show the last object
    - Creating a new object or new graph doesn't work
    - Solved by saving to different filename
    - graph.filename = 'filename'
    - Solved by rendering to a different temp file for each invocation
- Jupyter notebook can display graphviz.files.Source





GUI:
- tkinter
- GKT
